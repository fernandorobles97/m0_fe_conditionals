// -------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
// -------------------

var numberTeachers = 4
var numberStudents = 20
var stringTeachers = "4"
var numberDogs = 0

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents>= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <=20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);


// #-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
// #-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
// YOU DO: Explain. 
// The line of code is logging a conditional stating that the Number 4, using the comparison operator
// symbol for is less than, the Number 9. The statement will evaluate to true because 4 is less than 9.

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// A variable is declared with the name of books and the Number 3.
// A conditional is logged stating that Number 4, using the coparison operator for is less than, the name books. 
// The statement will evaluate false, because 4 is not less than the books Number value 3.

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain. 
// A variable is declared with the name of friends and the Number 6, another with the name of siblings
// and the Number 2. A conditional is logged stating that the name friends is greater than the name siblings. 
// This will evaluate to be true, because the Number 6 value for friends is greater than the Number 2 value for friends.

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
//  A variable is declared with the name attendees and the Number value 9, another with the name meals and the Number value 8.
// A conditional is logged stating that attendees is not strictly equal to meals. This will evaluate to be true because the attendees 
// Number value does not equal the meals Number value.  

// #-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
// #-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && age);

// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: It evaluted to 1. This is because there is no information regarding what age is considered a puppy.
// We are simply given the Number value 1 for age, which when invoked in a conditional cannot evaluate true or false.
